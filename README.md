Senior Design Project Goal:   <br>
To create a physical, soft bodied robot with actuators corresponding to each muscle.
Model will allow students to interact with it to better understand the effects each muscle has on tongue shape/speech

Senior Design Key Requirements: <br>
~Realistic model that mimics tongue motion <br>
~Portable (<50 lbs) <br>
~**User-friendly software/hardware <br>
~Control muscle contraction percentage with user-interface** <br>
~Educates students and researchers on functions of each tongue muscle <br>

How to use files: <br>
The data folder consists of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These are the main files for the layout and function of the user interface. The data files need to be uploaded to the esp 32 SPIFFS <br>

How to set up Arduino IDE to run files on esp32:<br>
-Install the Arduino IDE here https://www.arduino.cc/en/software<br>
-Steps 2, 3 and 4 from this tutorial: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-server-websocket-sliders/ [1]<br>
