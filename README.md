# Robotic_Tongue_GUI
User Interface Subsystem from Robotic Tongue Senior Design Project
Maritza Aguirre
 
Senior Design Project Goal:  
To create a physical, soft bodied robot with actuators corresponding to each muscle.
Model will allow students to interact with it to better understand the effects each muscle has on tongue shape/speech

Senior Design Key Requirements:
~Realistic model that mimics tongue motion
~Portable (<50 lbs)
~**User-friendly software/hardware
Control muscle contraction percentage with user-interface**
~Educates students and researchers on functions of each tongue muscle


How to use files:
The data folder consists of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These are the main files for the layout and function of the user interface. The data files need to be uploaded to the esp 32 SPIFFS 
How to set up Arduino IDE to run files on esp32:
-Install the Arduino IDE here https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
-Step 3 and 4 from this tutorial: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-server-websocket-sliders/
